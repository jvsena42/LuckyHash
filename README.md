**Mine Bitcoin. Win Big. All while watching your favorite show.**

## 🪙 Inspiration

Las Vegas — the city of bright lights, jackpots, and second chances — was the perfect backdrop for **LuckyHash**. We were inspired by the idea of turning idle devices and entertainment time into a shot at winning, combining the thrill of the **lottery** with the steady pulse of **Bitcoin mining**.

> Imagine watching your favorite TV show while your screen quietly mines in the background — and suddenly, you hit a lucky block. That’s LuckyHash.
